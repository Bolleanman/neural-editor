- We are drafting a more detailed README in the
  [README](https://github.com/kelvinguu/neural-editor/tree/readme) branch.
- This code requires a data directory that we have not uploaded yet.
- This is research code meant to serve as a reference implementation. We do not
  recommend heavily extending or modifying this codebase for other purposes.
